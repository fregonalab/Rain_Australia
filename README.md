## Description
The goal of this project was to develop an algoritm that could predict the next day weather condition. The methodology decided to tackle this challenge was to build a light, not heavy computentional expensive algoritm. To do so, we performed a extense feature engenerring process and data exploration analysis prior to the developtment of the M.L algoritm per se.
